This is a native Android App that i create to learn and improve my skills around jetpack compose.

I will use [D&D Api](https://www.dnd5eapi.co/) in this app to show game bestiary and for users
create your characters. I want to
improve the user experience with D&D.
Don't wast your time with game rules, only play the game while the software do the boring things.

I intent to create simple screens and then i will increment with more technologies and improve the
app structure and architecture

I think that's the best way to learn something.
